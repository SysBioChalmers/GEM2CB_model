This collection of files contains data acquired for mono-, bi- and tri-cultures carried out for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii DSM 17677 (FP), Roseburia intestinalis DSM 14610 (RI) and Blautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 (BH).

Fermentation experiments were carried out in 2-L Biostat B-DCU fermentors in batch mode. Anaerobic conditions during fermentations were assured by continuously sparging the medium with N2 at a flow rate of 70 mL min−1. The fermentation temperature was kept constant at 37 °C. A constant pH of 6.8 was imposed and controlled automatically, using 1.5 M solutions of NaOH and H3PO4. To keep the medium homogeneous, a gentle stirring of 200 rpm was applied.
