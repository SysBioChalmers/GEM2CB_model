This collection of files contains data acquired for mono-cultures of Blautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 (BH) without pH control. 

Experiments were performed in stationary glass bottles. The bottles contained 50 mL of heat-sterilized pH 6.8 mMCB medium. All bottles were incubated at 37Â°C in an anaerobic work station that was continuously sparged with a mixture of 80% N2, 10% CO2 and 10% H2. 

The consumption of the following substrates was tested at least in duplicate in two screening rounds:
D-Fructose
D-Glucose
D-Galactose
L-Fucose
Sodium formate
Sodium acetate trihydrate
Lactate
Oligofructose
Inulin

BH was also grown without substrate, to test autotrophic growth on CO2 in the headspace.

In addition, the GC-FID results (ethanol, acetoin, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid) for BH grown on formate are included.
